Checking for a duplex ADF, however, isn't 100% - it will rely on looking for text like "Duplex" in the options. For some scanners, this seems to be selected on the source option:

--source ADF Front|ADF Back|ADF Duplex

and for others, there is an extra adf_mode option:

--adf_mode Simplex|Duplex [Simplex]

others have a duplex option:

--duplex[=(yes|no)]
